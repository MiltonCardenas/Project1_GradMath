# PROJECT 1, MATHEMATICAL METHODS
Statystcial analysis of Pennsylvania COVID.

Analyze if the finding that relate working in agriculture sector with an increase of COVID-19 deaths made in the work of Chen et al (2021) can be extrapolated to the Top 5 states with the most agriculture workers. 

Analyze if the shutdown p

To have an accurate comparison, the data was segmented the same as in the work of Chen et al (2021)

## Sort criteria:

Decendent's usual occupation:
Food / agriculture

Age range:
18 - 65 years

Pandemic start time
March 1, 2020

March 1, 2020 -  June 1, 202 - July 1 2020

## ANALYSIS OF RESULTS
It is not possible to conclude anything about the slopes of the groups because of the p-value. We cannot be confident about the difference between the groups (for both, factor 1 and factor 2).

If we adjust the significance level for the p-value of the regression concerning the impact of the percentage of workers in the agricultural industry on COVID-19 deaths, it might lead to accepting the null hypothesis.

There is no significant difference in the impact on COVID-19 cases for individuals who work longer hours. The p-value is significantly distant from the threshold, making it unlikely that this factor is associated with COVID-19 mortality.

There is no significance in the overall regression model of the double-factor analysis.

## LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE ANALYSIS:
The COVID-19 deaths in the database were not directly linked to patient information, such as work-related details. A direct link would facilitate and improve the analysis.

Future analyses should investigate the influence of agricultural activity on mortality during documented pandemics to assess whether this population is susceptible to such events.

## CONCLUSIONS:
The p-value was significantly greater than the chosen significance level (e.g., 0.05). We find no statistically significant evidence that counties with higher weekly working hours were more likely to experience fatal outcomes in 2020.

While the p-value was close to the significance level, it did not meet the threshold for statistical significance. Therefore, we do not find sufficient evidence to conclude that counties with greater percentages of the food and agriculture-related industry were more prone to experiencing fatal outcomes in 2020.
